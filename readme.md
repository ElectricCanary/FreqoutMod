# FreqoutMod

## Intro

This is a mod for the [Digitech FreqOut](https://digitech.com/dp/freqout/) guitar pedal. It adds CV control to the "type" pot, making possible to create musical feedback easily. The CV will be generated by a peripheral with 4 momentary footswitches based on the Microchip Attiny84 microcontroller.

## Pedal Overview

The pedal is pretty well made, apparently it's made from the same circuit as the Ricochet. There's a single PCB for the power & DSP section. The face is done with three small PCBs connected between them by a ribbon. The face and the main PCB are connected by a header, pretty fragile.  
The analog section is powered by ±14V, which is impressive. The CODEC is a CS4272 by Cirrus Logic, the DSP is a DSPB56725AF by NXP, there's a STM8 microcontroller for the control.

## Pedal Mod

The only mod to the pedal itself is adding a switched jack on the "type" pot CV signal. The final assembly with the added jack isn't easy, but still doable.

## Peripheral

### Hardware



### Firmware

A filtered PWM output generates a voltage that replaces the one of the type pot. By combinating 3 footswitches, we can cover the 7 possible states of the type pot. The firmware is written for the ATtiny1606, for no particular reason, any µC with a PWM output could work.
